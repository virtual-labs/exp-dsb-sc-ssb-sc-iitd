      "question": "1. In a DSB-SC modulation scheme, assuming the message signal contains a wide range of frequency components, how would the sampling frequency requirement change if the message signal undergoes modulation, and how does the modulation scheme affect the risk of aliasing, considering the Nyquist-Shannon theorem?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The minimum sampling frequency for the modulated signal must be at least twice the maximum frequency of the message signal, as the modulation does not alter the frequency content significantly.",
        "b": "The minimum sampling frequency should be at least twice the highest frequency of the modulated signal, which may involve a frequency range that exceeds twice the message signal’s highest frequency due to the modulation scheme's bandwidth expansion.",
        "c": "Sampling at the Nyquist rate of the message signal is sufficient, as the modulation will inherently prevent aliasing by shifting the signal’s frequency spectrum.",
        "d": "The sampling frequency must be much higher than twice the message signal’s frequency due to the frequency doubling effect of DSB-SC modulation, but aliasing can still occur if the signal is not band-limited before sampling."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is incorrect because modulation in DSB-SC doubles the bandwidth of the signal, meaning the sampling frequency must account for the expanded frequency range, not just the message signal’s highest frequency.",
        "b": "The modulated signal will have a frequency range that is twice as wide as the message signal due to the nature of DSB-SC modulation, and thus the minimum sampling frequency must be twice the highest frequency of the modulated signal to avoid aliasing.",
        "c": "This is incorrect because the modulation process will shift and potentially expand the frequency spectrum, and simply applying the Nyquist rate of the message signal is not enough to prevent aliasing in the modulated signal.",
        "d": "This is partially correct in that the DSB-SC modulation does indeed cause a doubling of the bandwidth, but it overlooks the necessity of properly band-limiting the signal to prevent aliasing before sampling."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Signal power reduction is a factor, but distortions are more significant.",

        "c": "Non-ideal filtering can lead to distortions including frequency distortions and amplitude variations, affecting the quality of the recovered signal.",
